After installing Inkdrop, you may notice that the example notes in the app are written in a format called Markdown. If you're new to this, don't worry. We're here to introduce you to the world of Markdown and explain why it's such a favorite among developers and tech enthusiasts.

## What is Markdown?

At its core, Markdown is a lightweight markup language, designed to be easily readable and writeable by humans. Think of it as a simpler cousin to HTML. Instead of using intricate tags and attributes like HTML, Markdown uses plain text symbols. For instance, wrapping a word in `*` asterisks `*` will make it *italicized*, while using `**` double asterisks `**` will make it **bold**.

{% snippet lang="md" filename="example.md" %}
```
Hello, **World**!
This is *Italic*.

- List item 1
- List item 2
```
{% /snippet %}

## Why Use Markdown?

1. **Simplicity**: You don't need to be a programmer to understand or use Markdown. Its syntax is straightforward, making it accessible to beginners.

2. **Portability**: Because Markdown is just plain text, you can open and edit it in any text editor. This means your notes, documents, and writings are not tied down to a specific software or platform.

3. **Versatility**: As you dive deeper into the tech world, you'll discover that Markdown is almost everywhere:

   - **Code Hosting Platforms**: GitHub and GitLab, where millions of developers host their projects, use Markdown for README files, comments, and documentation.
   
   - **Communication Tools**: Apps like Slack and Discord allow you to format messages with Markdown.
   
   - **Forums**: Discourse, a popular forum software, adopts Markdown for its posts.
   
   - **Websites and Blogs**: Many modern website generators like Ghost, Jekyll, and Gatsby use Markdown as their primary content format.

4. **Consistency**: Since Markdown renders uniformly across platforms, what you write is what you get. Whether you're viewing your note in Inkdrop, on GitHub, or any other Markdown-supporting platform, the presentation remains consistent.

5. **Open Standard**: Markdown is not owned by a corporation or tied to a specific software. It's an open standard, which means anyone can use or adapt it.

### Learning Markdown and its Role in Inkdrop

Notebooks are a core feature in Inkdrop that help you manage and organize your notes. They work just like folders in filesystem. You can nest notebooks in one another as deeply as needed. Let's explain what they are and how they can help you level up your workspace.{% .lead %}

## Use your sidebar

![sidebar](/images/create-a-notebook_sidebar.png)

The sidebar is the leftmost section of the app.
it displays a tree view of notebooks.
Each notebook item has a number badge on the right side that indicates the number of notes in the notebook.
If a notebook has sub-notebook(s), it has a triangle icon on the left side that you can click to expand or collapse the notebook.

## Add a notebook

To create a new notebook, click the {% icon name="add-circle" /%} icon next to the **Notebooks** title:

![Add notebook](/images/create-a-notebook_add.png)

To create a sub notebook:

1. Right-click the notebook, which will be the parent, and select **New Sub Notebook..**.
2. Provide a title for the nested notebook.
3. Click **Create**.  
   The newly created notebook will appear inside the parent one.

To create a new note, you can either click the {% icon name="pencil-write" /%} icon on the right top of the note list or use the {% kbd %}Command+N{% /kbd %} / {% kbd %}Ctrl+N{% /kbd %} shortcut.

## Configure the default notebook

When creating a new note in the **All Notes** section, it will be created in the default notebook.
You may want to change it after creating notebooks.
It can be changed from **Inkdrop** > **Preferences** > **General** > **Default notebook**.
